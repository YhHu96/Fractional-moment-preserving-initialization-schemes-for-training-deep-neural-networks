# Fractional-moment-preserving-initialization-schemes-for-training-deep-neural-networks
This folder includes the codes for the paper "Fractional moment-preserving initialization schemes
for training fully-connected neural networks", which can be read through https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11878.

To run these codes, one should include the "pytroch" package in the environment which can be accessed through https://pytorch.org/. The figures in the paper can be reproduced by running the code in this folder. The code is named by the figure number. These notebook files include the figure, so figures are shown when open the code file.

We added two initialization method in the init file called random walk and yuanhan. Yuanhan is our method in the paper, and random-walk is the initialization method proposed in the paper "Random walks: Training very deep nonlinear feed-forward networks with smart initialization".
